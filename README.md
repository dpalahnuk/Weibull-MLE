# Weibull PDF - non-normal MLE and JMP Ppk ANOVA 

Weibull PDF (Proabability Density) -> non-normal MLE and JMP Ppk ANOVA 

## Description 

For ceiling-type data, such as vial thaw viability data (often bounded by 100%), a normal distribution may not adequately represent the distribution. In this case, the Weibull distribution is a better fit due to its flexible shape, which can account for the skewness of the data.

The document provides an example where the Weibull distribution is applied to cell culture vial thaw viability data using JMP. This data type typically does not follow a normal distribution, so the Weibull distribution is chosen to calculate process capability indices, like Ppk using a lower specification limit (LSL) set to 80%. In the example, a Ppk value of 3.9 is obtained, indicating that the process capability is within acceptable limits.

This analysis helps in deriving a meaningful capability measure even for data that is not normally distributed, especially when bounded by a ceiling value like 100%.

## Analysis 
1. Show the mathematics for a Weibull pdf and how it is analyzed using MLE. 
2. Show how pdf type can be applied in JMP to 100% Ceiling type vial thaw viability data.
